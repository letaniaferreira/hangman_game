Word Guess
---
App that allows users to play hangman

The app was originally designed as a command line game and it is currently being adapted to be a web app. 

In order to play the command line version of the game you should have Python 3 installed on your machine and run the following command:

`python cli/word_guess.py`

The web app version is not finished but the code base is available here.
